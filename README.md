# Digital Forensics / Incident Response - The Definitive Compendium Project

Accessible @ https://goo.gl/0NmiaV

Digital Forensics is my passion - its the ultimate investigative experience in my opinion. I'm also an avid learner, both by hands-on doing and learning from others. To that end, I created a multi-tabbed project for the tracking of Digital Forensics:

  Certifications and Training
  Undergraduate Degrees
  Post-Graduate Degrees
  Forensics Associations & Memberships
  Social Resources
  Mages, eMags, and Whitepapers
  Books
  Blogs
  Challenges and Research

If you see a mistake, want to fill in missing information, or add something new - leave a comment directly on the Google sheet, send me a tweet @aei4n6, or connect on LinkedIn (make sure to send me a message as I don't confirm blind Connect requests) and I will confirm after reviewing as well as provide you credit in the Change Log.

Thank you!
