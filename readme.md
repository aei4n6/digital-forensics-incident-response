# Digital Forensics / Incident Response - The Definitive Compendium Project

Accessible @ [https://goo.gl/0NmiaV]

Digital Forensics/Incident Response is my passion - its the ultimate investigative experience in my opinion. I'm also an avid learner, both by hands-on doing and learning from others. To that end, I created a multi-tabbed project for the tracking of Digital Forensics-related training and education resources:

  - Certifications and Training
  - Undergraduate Degrees
  - Post-Graduate Degrees
  - Forensics Associations & Memberships
  - Social Resources
  - Mages, eMags, and Whitepapers
  - Books
  - Blogs
  - Challenges and Research
  
If you see a mistake, want to fill in missing information, or add something new, you can do so any of the following ways:

  - leave a comment directly on the Google sheet
  - send me a tweet [@aei4n6](https://twitter.com/aei4n6 "@aei4n6")
  - connect on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/devonackerman "LinkedIn")
  + make sure to send me a message as I don't confirm blind Connect requests

I will confirm the suggested edit after reviewing as well as provide you credit in the Change Log.

Thank you!
